Using python to read and write into excel files

In this python script, using xlrd and xlsxwriter, I am reading certain data from 4 excel documents and writing it into another document. Then, using VLOOKUP (an excel formula), we search for each element in the first column in each of the other columns. For my purpose, I needed data starting at specific rows and columns and I used dummy excel files to test.
